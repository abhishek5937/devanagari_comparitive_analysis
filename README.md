- The purpose of this project is to compare several state-of-the-art algorithms
for Character Recognition on the basis of various parameters for the prediction
of Hindi language characters and identify the best algorithm which will be
able to perform the prediction for Hindi language characters.
- It is also desirable that the algorithm must take time factor into consideration:
Both training and validation time.
- It is desirable that the loss factors of the best algorithm should be minimum.
- The project should be able to clearly compare the algorithms on the basis of
accuracy graphs, loss graphs, and time graphs.
- The objective is to take every common parameter of the different algorithm
models indistinguishable in order to compare the algorithms in a better way.
